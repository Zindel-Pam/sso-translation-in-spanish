769	What is happening?
770	Answers will be given in the future.
771	For now, just get out of here.
772	What was that?
773	Oh, what a disappointment!
774	Is that the speed of your punches?
775	Idiot!
776	Insignificant Bronze Knight!
777	Very slow!
778	Before you die, I'll take you to see a person.
779	Is this ...
780	the Sanctuary?
781	Why did you bring me here?
782	Marin!

845	Eliminated!
846	Palate
847	Vision
848	What are your last words, before you lose your five senses?

852	Invocation of the Evil Spirits

854	Dispérsense!
855	Become ashes in the midst of that fiery fire of Hell!
856	What? What sensation is that?
857	What threatening Cosmo is that?
858	No matter how many times you knock me down, as long as my Cosmo burns, the Phoenix will not be extinguished!
859	The smell of roses mixed with blood is fascinating!
860	How cold! I'm dead?
861	What place is that?
862	This is the land of forgotten souls
863	Then forget the souls, and come fight!
864	But how bragged you are!
865	You really embarrass me.
866	Betraying my teachings, contrary to the Golden Knights ...!
867	Master, it's not that! They are hiding the truth!
868	Master!
869	Sinner, it will go through my judgment for having betrayed the Shrine!
870	No, I did not traction!
871	Oh, how useless!
872	As a Knight, it is absurd that you do not have the capacity to protect the Goddess!
873	You're so useless!
874	Hunf! This is very boring.
875	What ?! How is it possible?
876	You were careless!
877	The moment I felt more confused
878	I felt the fighting spirit of the Armor.
879	It was the Armor that woke me up!
880	He's already on the verge of death and he still does not want to give up.
881	What are those petals?
882	Hmm, this is getting interesting.
883	Master, it's not that! They are hiding the truth!
884	Master!
885	Your attacks definitely do not affect me!
886	It turns out, all your fighting skills
887	were taught by me!
888	Do not boast, you're just an illusion!
889	Hunf, what do you think you're seeing?
890	Stop saying nonsense!
891	You are stubborn! I think you need to see and experience a little of the real Diamond Dust!
892	He really is a disciple of Camus! Identified my fake body!
893	But, unfortunately,
894	you will stay here forever.
895	I remembered ...
896	I was trapped in a freezing coffin!
897	Damn! And now?
898	Is that all? You really embarrass me!
899	You seem to have forgotten all my teachings!
900	So is it like that? Do you intend to resign?
901	What are you seeing? Wake up your Cosmo, destroy that ice coffin!
902	Destroy ... But ... My strength ...
903	If you call yourself a disciple of Camus, then prove it to me so that I can see!
904	I will!
905	Athena ...
906	Please give me strength,
907	Even for a fraction of a second!
908	I'm back!
909	Did you not appreciate the ice coffin that was given to you? He came back only to die!
910	How ... How is it possible?
911	The Diamond Dust is surprising you, they are equal to the same!
912	Incorrect. The great power of your Diamond Dust is weakening!
913	Incorrect. The great power of your Diamond Dust is weakening!
914	You have only delayed your destiny!
915	Go to Hell !!
916	It seems I need to take things a little more seriously
917	It's not over yet!
918	Not bad, nothing bad
919	It seems that you are not completely useless
920	It's a shame
921	But his strength is not even close to that of the Golden Knights
922	Feel the terror of my power!
923	Young Knight, the road ahead is full of thorns
924	Can you stand it?
925	Strength can conquer everything
926	To achieve inexhaustible power, you will have to follow the path of evil
927	Are you ready?
928	That guy still has a little energy
929	I'll put it under my control, I bet it will have some use
930	We will see each other again
931	But ... What is that feeling?
932	I will not accept your control
933	Do not tell me ...
934	Exact
935	Your attempts to deceive me
936	are useless
937	In my interior, I had already decided my goals a long time ago
938	The Scale decided to support me
939	Get ready
940	Then
941	you have no more use
942	You can barely stand up! I'm going to send you to hell!
943	I did not expect his body to hide that strength
944	After the explosion of its Cosmo, the intensity of its force increased
945	However, my strength is still above yours
946	Well, what power!
947	Even if I'm called a genius, I will not lose with you
948	Oh, it's that feeling again
949	I won, Eide!
950	Look, right at the moment, how could I lose?
951	Well, that Cosmo
952	It became so strange ...
953	Eide
954	How fast!
955	The Cosmo of Eide disappeared
956	How is it possible?
957	Eide, wake up!
958	&name& that Cosmo is very dangerous. Stop it now!
959	Listen ...
960	The universe ....
961	He was born 15 billion years ago, in the Big Bang.
962	Actually ...
963	Your own body is one of the microuniverses resulting from that great explosion.
964	The Knights manifest their energy by exploiting their inner universes.
965	With that energy, they are capable of tearing the sky and cracking open the earth.
966	That energy is called Cosmo.
967	Besides the Cosmo ...
968	Each Knight has his own Protective Constellation and Armor
969	If the constellation of Cygnus is your guardian sign,

981	Pegasus Armor will give you extreme speed. By using it, you will have faster strokes.
982	If the Andromeda constellation is your guardian sign,
983	then your Armor must be Andromeda.
984	The Andromeda Armor is the only one that uses weapons. By using it, you will have maximum attack and defense.
985	The fire of the Twelve Houses has been lit. That is the sign of the Sanctuary to ward off intruders.

1005	Golden Armor ...!
1006	I will strive to increase my Cosmo and become a stronger Knight!
1007	I feel my body full of energy ...!
1008	We can not waste any more time!
1009	They are really persistent, ha ha ha ha!
1010	Who is it?
1011	I thank you for the blood of the King of the Underworld.
1012	Now go to Hell!
1013	Get out of here fast!
1014	But, Roderio ...!
1015	Hurry up! I will stop him.
1016	It's no use running away!
1017	Hunf! Smug!
1018	One more is still missing ...
1019	Stop!
1020	Your opponent is me!
1021	What do you think you can do with that empty body?
1022	While the fire of my soul is on
1023	I will prevent you!
1024	Prevent me?
1025	Ha ha ha ha!
1026	That's what we'll see, then!
1027	Centuries of resentment ...
1028	It's time to put an end to all this!
1029	Let's transform ourselves into Cosmic dust together, Thanatos!
1030	This is the Pegasus Knight's pride!
1031	This Cosmo ... it's Roderio!
1032	The soul of the first Pegasus Knight will soon come to an end.
1033	You! Why are you here?
1034	I only attracted a group of alchemists and apprentices to the forest
1035	Their fear caused them to deliver the secret of the blood of the King of the Underworld.
1036	However, I want to thank you. I thought I would get Alex's trust
1037	But, obviously, you're more suitable
1038	Damn!
1039	Make yourself comfortable, because you will not get away!
1040	Be obedient and surrender the blood of the King of the Underworld.
1041	I'm not giving it to you!
1042	You talk too much, Pandora.
1043	Mr. Hypnos ...!
1044	My body ... It does not move!
1045	Take the blood and let's go!
1046	Yes, sir.
1047	Calm down, I do not like to kill.
1048	Eternal dream!
1049	Young justice, knight of the stars!
1050	This gentle Cosmo ... Maybe it's ..?
1051	Never give in to evil! Wake up, my Knight!
1052	Athena!
1053	Knight of Hope, I give you the blessing of Mount Olympus, representing the Goddess.
1054	Hunf! Satan...
1055	... Imperial!
1056	Welcome to the Shrine
1057	Do not worry, that will send you to Hell.
1058	Plasma Lightning!
1059	Great Horn!
1060	We have achieved!
1061	Of course not. I think I should give you a sample of my power!
1062	That's bad ...
1063	It's not good, if it continues like this ...
1064	Simple mortals dare to hurt me, Thanatos!
1065	That's unforgivable!
1066	It is inevitable that the fire of evil will be extinguished.
1067	Protecting Athena, love and justice, is the mission of all of us, Golden Knights!
1068	Even if we lose honor or life.
1069	Shaka ...!
1070	No matter how powerful the enemy is
1071	we must fight until the end.
1072	That's all we can do.
1073	We will protect the Sanctuary of Athena through the
1074	Exclamation of Athena!
1075	The forbidden blow ?!
1076	Hurry, we take care of that!
1077	I imagine that the House of Aries is unprotected. How easy was it to go through it?
1078	You can boast about having arrived at the Taurus house, but you will not get out of here!
1079	Run away while there is still time!
1080	You are looking for problems ...
1081	That guy ... I do not think he's capable of ...
1082	Yes, you are skillful, but ...
1083	You forgot something important:
1084	Your opponent ...
1085	It's me, Aldebaran!
1086	But ...
1087	... you did it very well. LOL!
1088	Remember that the Holy War occurs since the era of mythology
1089	The disaster happened suddenly
1090	Hades invaded the Sanctuary
1091	Athena, the Guardian of Earth and Peace
1092	Led a ferocious counter-attack against Hades
1093	At that time, the golden knight of Sagittarius gave his life
1094	In exchange for the weapon of Prometheus
1095	When evil came again
1096	Athena used the strength of the Prometheus Hammer
1097	And together with his knights, they prevented the attack of Hades
1098	And they made Hades shed a drop of blood
1099	For thousands of years, to recover his power, Hades is behind the whereabouts of the lost blood
1100	Let me remember ... The story happened thirteen years ago
1101	The brother of the Leo Knight, Aiolia
1102	was the Golden Knight of Sagittarius, Aioros
1103	Aioros was the bravest and most righteous Knight
1104	However, thirteen years ago, attracted by the force of darkness, Aioros betrayed Athena
1105	Aiolos tried to kill Athena and was discovered by the Grand Master
1106	And then, I flee from the Sanctuary
1107	The Grand Master sent the Shura of Capricorn to kill Aioros, who died on the Path of Oblivion
1108	During all these years, Aiolia was described as the 'brother of the traitor'
1109	During the long battle
1110	His strength woke up
1111	Now,
1112	The time has come to take on the new force
1113	This is the power of the Golden Armor
1114	I was defeated! I will have to give you control
1115	But remember! in the moment that justice vacillates your interior,
1116	I'm going to take advantage to dominate your body again
1117	How can there be someone with the Cosmo so strong?
1118	With the attention of everyone ...
1119	This day has finally arrived!
1120	Let's go to action! Get out of my way!
1121	Only about my corpse!
1122	It seems that the difference between the strength of a golden knight and yours is not yet clear!
1123	How is it possible ?? I can not see his hit!
1124	It is useless to resist! You are not a rival to me
1125	I'll never let you take your armor!
1126	How strong!
1127	Even if he loses his life ...
1128	I will stop you!
1129	Pegasus Meteor !!
1130	Hunf! That is all?
1131	I'll show you what speed is!
1132	Oh! Seiya
1133	The armor of Sagittarius !?
1134	Why?
1135	Armor ...
1136	In that direction is the Sanctuary!
1137	Aiolia, have you still not understood?
1138	That Cosmo is so strong and soft!
1139	Could it be that she really is Athena?
1140	Miss Saori!
1141	Seiya, you won!
1142	The armor is yours!
1143	The mountain will fall apart
1144	Go!
1145	Come with us!
1146	No, maybe that's my destiny!
1147	Goodbye, my brother!
1148	Here is very dangerous, let me get you out of that place!
1149	Finally, I left the forest of nightmares
1150	It's finished, Athena
1151	This ... It seems like it happened a long time ago ...
1152	Is it a dream ...?
1153	This new armor was obtained at the cost of Shiryu's blood!
1154	I'm going to use it to achieve victory!
1155	They are arriving
1156	That was thirteen years ago
1157	My grandfather, Mitsumasa Kido, found a warrior very hurt while traveling through Greece
1158	He was the Golden Knight of Sagittarius, Aiolos!
1159	Aioros told my grandfather
1160	that the baby in his arms was the reincarnation of Athena and forces of evil wanted to kill her
1161	Before dying, Aioros handed over the armor of Sagittarius and Athena to my grandfather
1162	Please, protect her! Athena is the only hope in this world! Aioros said
1163	That baby
1164	It was me!
1165	Shiryu, I cover you!
1166	Okay!
1167	Receive my blow, Mask of Death!
1168	Is that all you can do?
1169	Shiryu, now!
1170	Flying Dragon!
1171	Very good, Shiryu!
1172	You are only Bronze Knights ...!
1173	Shiryu, be careful!
1174	Who? ... Han ?!
1175	Mask of Death ...
1176	What? Teacher...!
1177	You!
1178	For now, I'll let you live!
1179	I wait for you in the Sanctuary!
1180	Shiryu, let's see who is the best!
1181	Come on, friend!
1182	Rising Dragon!
1183	What happened to you, friend? Wake up!
1184	This is where we trained ...
1185	We have to become stronger, Shiryu!
1186	Shiryu, do not give up!
1187	Lei-Hu, why did you stay like that?
1188	Do not you remember the Master, of Rozan ...?
1189	Wake up!
1190	Ma ... Teacher ...
1191	Idiot! To get rid of my control, only with the ...
1192	DEATH!
1193	Die, Shiryu !!
1194	Sorry, friend ...!
1195	I've lost ... At last you became the strongest, Shiryu ...
1196	Lei-Hu ...!
1197	Now, I will send you to Hell!
1198	Tch, tch ...
1199	Leave that with me! Both of you, do not be stuck here!
1200	Go!
1201	What is that? I can not distract myself from appearing ...
1202	One more mouse?
1203	Well ...
1204	Let everyone come!
1205	Damn !!
1206	¡Ley-hu !!
1207	Weak!
1208	Damn !!
1209	Nobody leaves!
1210	I will not die without first defeating you, Shiryu!
1211	Get out, fast!
1212	Shunrei !!
1213	The only way to save Shunrei is by reversing the flow of the Great Cascade ...
1214	I promise I will, Shunrei!
1215	Has understood the blow ...!
1216	Report your wish, I will do it.
1217	Goodness
1218	Understood I will fulfill your wish.
1219	Dragon
1220	Do you think you can defeat us like that?
1221	We will show you the true power of the God of Dreams
1222	Is that all?
1223	That Cosmo ...
1224	It will be ...
1225	Everyone who knows the truth must die
1226	Galactic Explosion !!
1227	Run away ... Fast ...
1228	Hilda ...
1229	Let's see who is going to save you this time
1230	No! Do not bother! I'm losing your Cosmo
1231	Knights, protect the Goddess!
1232	Destiny changes constantly, as do the phases of the moon ...
1233	The life experience has ups and downs, joy and sadness, union and separation
1234	In short, everything is summarized in a peaceful dream, disappearing like ice and snow ...
1235	And the wheel of destiny turns constantly, tirelessly.
1236	Happiness is transient, subtracting only suffering and torture.
1237	Your goddess brings hatred and fear to people ...
1238	At the same time, it causes people to worship it out of fear of divine punishment.
1239	In the moment I touch the strings and invoke the words of God
1240	Let me hear the sad fate, be it life or death.
1241	He defeated the shadow of the sea, we can not forgive him!
1242	Wait!
1243	I still have something to ask you!
1244	Save me!
1245	I can make you the king of this world!
1246	Look at the stones!
1247	They can be crushed!
1248	Haha !! finally, I'm free
1249	It's time!
1250	Awaken, oh, dormant resentments in the depths of the Island of the Queen of Death
1251	Seiya, you are warriors chosen by God, the knights of hope
1252	They can not die
1253	This Cosmo is ...
1254	It seems that things are not so simple. I'm going to leave you out while.
1255	Great, if we beat him, my brother will wake up
1256	Do you really believe that you can defeat me?
1257	In the world of illusion created by me, I am the almighty God
1258	No one can kill me.
1259	Shun
1260	Good defense. But let me show you the strength that Mr. Guilty gave me.
1261	Her ... Brother ....
1262	Do you think this illusion is able to stop me ??
1263	Phoenix Bird!
1264	Ignorant creature!
1265	Since you want so much to die
1266	Treasure of Heaven!
1267	God gave his punishment
1268	The volcano erupted
1269	Even if he does not do anything
1270	You will not escape death
1271	Ikki
1272	Do not say anything else
1273	But ...
1274	You have more important things that you do
1275	And the Island of the Queen Death is my house
1276	Therefore, I have to defend it
1277	Board on board
1278	It seems you have decided to be my enemy
1279	Hyoga
1280	I'll give you one last chance
1281	If you do not accept, then do not blame me
1282	Forget, Alexer!
1283	I'm going to stop your conspiracy and get the Oricalco
1284	It's really ... A pity
1285	This is the resistance I expected!
1286	Blue impulse!
1287	Attack!
1288	The Knight of the Cygnus will never yield!
1289	Diamond powder!
1290	Hunf ... This time I'll let it go!
1291	But in the not too distant future, the power of Cygnus will be used by me
1292	Kanon, why?
1293	I have abandoned the identity of the substitute of the Golden Knight of Gemini a long time ago
1294	Now ...
1295	I am the Marine Dragon General
1296	I'm going to show you the true power of a
1297	Of the 7 Marine Generals
1298	Golden Triangle!
1299	The Oricalco ...
1300	You will not get it!
1301	How naive
1302	You
1303	They're going to pay for that!
1304	Isaak
1305	He has not died, he is still alive!
1306	Alexer, have you reached any conclusion?
1307	Asgard Warriors
1308	We do not want war
1309	But when the invasion happens
1310	We use our own bodies to defend our homeland
1311	Many brothers sacrificed for victory
1312	But, while we're still standing here, nobody ...
1313	You can defeat us
1314	Stand up, warriors!
1315	Fight for Asgard!
1316	Kanon
1317	Do not let it spoil my plan
1318	It seems to be the only way
1319	Imperial Satan!
1320	How long ...
1321	Have I fallen asleep?
1322	I need your strength, Hyoga
1323	Come to our side
1324	No way! I will not be an accomplice in your invasion to the south
1325	Diamond dust!
1326	What? My hit has no effect?
1327	Hunf, Impulse Blue!
1328	Take it!
1329	What !?
1330	This is a fight between him and me! Do not mess!
1331	Hunf, I can not believe that you would ally the Knights of Athena
1332	It does not matter!
1333	No more nonsense!
1334	Where are you looking?
1335	The winds of the hurricane!
1336	Destroy the main pillar
1337	Attack!
1338	Impossible!
1339	You ... I will not forgive you!
1340	You failed, Poseidon
1341	What are you holding?
1342	The amphora of Athena
1343	Sorry, Athena
1344	Awakening in this era was his only intention. Go back to sleep, Poseidon
1345	Stop, Athena! You will regret!
1346	Maintaining peace in the world is my mission!
1347	Your weakness, you do not deserve to die in my own hands
1348	But it would make me happy to send you to another world
1349	More desperate than I thought
1350	Just as you wish ...
1351	Aiolia
1352	No hurry! Soon it's your time
1353	It can not end like this
1354	&name& you are the last hope
1355	Athena is with you
1356	How dare you enter the Holy Underworld?
1357	While they can not find it,
1358	Kill it!
1359	Final blow
1360	It's Athena! Hold it!
1361	Hungry and reckless ghosts, come
1362	Your heights have turned black
1363	Seek your destiny in reincarnation
1364	Kanon, we'll settle accounts later
1365	Lord, leave that Knight with us, please!
1366	Idiot, even if there were hundreds of you, you would not be pareo for him!
1367	What love to subordinates! You can go!
1368	What? Moron! Do not be arrogant!
1369	You will feel all our power!
1370	Would you like to see what real 'power' is?
1371	What a lack of emotion!
1372	From ... Has it disappeared?
1373	Pandora
1374	You will never pass through here!
1375	Pegasus Meteor
1376	Stop us!
1377	Come on!
1378	If you want to kill me, you will have to prevent me from eclipse, on the contrary, I will not allow anyone to die
1379	Then, Athena? Were you not willing to give your life of your own free will?
1380	Wake up now!
1381	What happened?
1382	Athena's blood ... It's too hot!
1383	I can feel ...
1384	I get to feel the Cosmo of Shun
1385	While I am alive, I have an obligation to protect all lives and that is why I have reincarnated myself in this age. Get out of Shun's body, Hades!
1386	You must understand that there is no point in continuing to fight. Interrupts eclipse, Hades
1387	I want you to be like me
1388	I will destroy you
1389	His only strings that can issue the attack notes have already been cut by me
1390	Now he dies!
1391	Your face of despair makes me happy
1392	Since you came here, I've never been able to play for Mr. Hades
1393	I'm going to tell you the truth before you die
1394	The sun that you are seeing is my masterpiece
1395	Damn Orpheus!
1396	Balance of curse!
1397	You ...
1398	Have you used your teeth to hold the strings?
1399	Arayashiki
1400	The Holy War is about to begin. I can feel your Cosmo
1401	You must awaken Arayashiki
1402	Your previous experiences can no longer help
1403	New experiences are necessary for the battle
1404	New experiences
1405	Yes ...
1406	To defeat the golden knights, you will have to burn your Cosmo to the highest level
1407	That is,
1408	Awakening your seventh sense
1409	Seventh sense?
1410	That!
1411	Seventh sense is an existence that surpasses the six common senses
1412	You have to understand
1413	Your armors must also be repaired
1414	It looks like the armor is full of energy
1415	Come on! We do not have much time!
1416	Noo you are my opponent
1417	Get out of here!
1418	How can I be defeated here?
1419	Saori, I will save you!
1420	Burn, my Cosmo!
1421	Pegasus Meteor!
1422	It is a force completely from the previous
1423	I'll have to take it seriously.
1424	Supernova Titanic!
1425	I'm going to take them to find the Grand Master
1426	But ...
1427	... In the shape of corpses!
1428	Get my punch!
1429	Ghost Arrows!
1430	Hehehehe
1431	They can not save this woman
1432	To the young people who came here! I entrust them to you Athena ---- Aioros
1433	Cassios
1434	He will only wake up in this way
1435	Hurry up!
1436	It seems that my collections collection is going to win a new specimen
1437	Immerse yourself in this endless dream
1438	Disclaimer
1439	You definitely will not get away
1440	It was for insignificant things
1441	Have you come to disturb my sleep?
1442	What happens ...
1443	Do you want to die?
1444	Let's have some fun!
1445	Do not try to cross there in vain
1446	Is he dead?
1447	Get up
1448	To, Shura
1449	It does not matter if you explain it
1450	Since this is the case, I have no way out if I do not use all my strength and put our lives at risk
1451	Atomic Thunder
1452	Golden arrow
1453	Hunf, go to hell!
1454	Receives
1455	Shura
1456	Take! Go dead!
1457	reached
1458	Before saving, save yourself
1459	I can not get involved in this
1460	Come here, please
1461	Take
1462	Beautiful blow
1463	How I wanted to know the truth
1464	Just come with me
1465	Help ... Save me!
1466	You have finally discovered
1467	Who is it?
1468	Do not get nervous
1469	What will happen next will be even more interesting
1470	The chosen one needs to select a Scale to accept the challenge
1471	I wish that
1472	Find an answer as quickly as possible
1473	Good luck
1474	Are you arriving now? How slow!
1475	It seems that you need to train a little more
1476	Courage! Go through the fire test of Leo
1477	^ ff0000 (attract the Leo test examiner for the flames can make him be defeated faster)
1478	Protects the way to the Sanctuary
1479	Do not let any enemy pass! If not, the result will be disastrous!
1480	Forward! For Mr. Hades! Destroy the temple!
1481	I did not expect you to defeat a spectrum
1482	A strange Cosmo has arisen next to the statue of Athena
1483	Go protect the statue of Athena
1484	Follow me
1485	Do not delay
1486	As the King of the Underworld allowed my reincarnation, I will fight for him
1487	Shameless! Fighting in the midst of so much suffering
1488	Welcome to the illusion of Pisces
1489	I am Aphrodite, the warrior of beauty
1490	Defeat me
1491	And I'll admit you as a Knight
1492	Capture Saori Kido
1493	Come on, my boy
1494	Capture it for me
1495	Saori Kido
1496	Your time has come
1497	We are going to stop here
1498	Even if I could save her, it would not make any sense
1499	Because
1500	Lord Poseidon
1501	He has already woken up
1502	In addition,
1503	I have prepared a pleasant surprise for you
1504	I hope you like it
1505	To protect the multitude of the frozen lands
1506	Even if I become your enemy
1507	I will not doubt
1508	Dohko
1509	Unforgivable
1510	Come with me, Saga. I'm going to end this myself
1511	Saga
1512	Why do you still have doubts?
1513	We'll see how long you'll hold
1514	What unnecessary effort
1515	You will drown in my shadow
1516	He has run away
1517	Leave it, it is clear that it is not a priority
1518	We have more important things
1519	What a strong pressure!
1520	My body and armor seem to be being crushed
1521	If you continue like this, I can die here
1522	Maybe
1523	Is it true that only a god can reach Champs Elysees?
1524	Is that the power of a golden knight?
1525	It's too much nonsense
1526	To make me, the King of the Underworld, come personally to execute you is an honor
1527	Die, Pegasus!
1528	We are going to end this war
1529	I agree
1530	Hades, you can have it for sure, that I will make you be punished
1531	Athena, you are only here to see your petty humanity die
1532	Feel the power of justice
1533	It is impossible
1534	I am the King of the Underworld! I dont believe it! I can not believe it!
1535	Each of us will return to the world of light
1536	While your power disappears, Athena, I will manage to dominate the whole universe
1537	Stop!
1538	Many people have already been sacrificed!
1539	We must stop now with this war!
1540	For love and peace ...
1541	For eternal salvation ...
1542	For the purification of every bloodstained earth ...
1543	Fight by my side!
1544	No
1545	Was it just a dream?
1546	What is happening?
1547	I will make the remnants of the Underworld feel the divine punishment!
1548	Is this the power of the Virgo Knight? Amazing!
1549	You're going to flee, right?
1550	Come with me, fast!
1551	Hunf ...
1552	Do not pay attention to him
1553	Let's go fast
1554	Where ... am I?
1555	He finally woke up!
1556	You have slept for a long time ...
1557	Uh ...
1558	Where am I?
1559	Oh, it's a Siren ...
1560	Answer me, why did the sea bring you?
1561	If the Star of Ferocity is your guardian sign,
1562	then his armor must be that of Wyrm.
1563	When dressing Wyrm's Armor, you will have the power of darkness.
1564	If the mystical Dragon of the Sea is your guardian sign,
1565	Then your scale should be that of the Sea Dragon
1566	The Sea Dragon Scale has the strength of the Ocean. By using it, you control the seas
1567	Is that all you have?
1568	Let me see your true strength ...
1569	That's right ...
1570	Just a little more ...
1571	Did you see?
1572	This is his true power.
1573	In the end, he was right about you
1574	Ha ha ha!
1575	Oh, you almost reach the speed of light! Attacks come from all directions
1576	But, unfortunately ...
1577	I started to find you bored
1578	See
1579	The true power
1580	Interesting!
1581	Ahhhh !!!!
1582	Is it over?
1583	You should be happy because I temporarily change my mind
1584	But remember: to regenerate the body a new explosion of the Cosmo is necessary
1585	We will still meet again
1586	It seems that the Cosmo is flowing in my body
1587	I am the winner
1588	Oh, Cassios lost!
1589	You can not even stand
1590	This level ...
1591	It's not enough to be one of my puppets ...
1592	This Cosmo ...
1593	This force
1594	I can not control it
1595	What ... What incredible strength
1596	What is that?
1597	There must be something wrong
1598	If the constellation of Lira is your guardian sign,
1599	then his armor must be Lyra's.
1600	The Armor of Lira has the most beautiful musical tone. By using it, you will have the power of music
1601	Young one!
1602	Prepare yourself to protect Athena!
