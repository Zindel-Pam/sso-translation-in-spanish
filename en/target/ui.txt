4062	Participating every day of the events, you will receive several divine offerings that can be sacrifices for the goddess. If one day, the sacrifices that the army offers exceeds the amount of 30, the goddess will increase the level of that army to level 2. After level 2, the army will be able to upgrade from New only if it is within the base of the army in the "Home of the gods".
4063	At the foot of Mount Olympus, there is a piece of land known as "Home of the Gods", in the middle, mortals can find the knights who died, heroes of the past, as well as many gods. The goddess allows the Knights to enter and leave the center, in addition to delimiting a base, allowing the strong armies to be stationed in the center. The patents of the army will go to level 2 or one level above, if the current army chief was qualified to request the army base of the "Home of the gods". Due to the limited number of bases, the goddess will organize the strongest armies to park in the center!
4064	In the home of the gods, Knights can get many gifts and blessings, and you can find items that do not exist in the mortal world. In order to improve communication with the gods, you need to raise the level of your army, as well as the level of the army temple. Of course, in between, there are some deities that do not like the human race, so, to protect Athena, the army needs even more knights to enter, the goddess will reward her!
